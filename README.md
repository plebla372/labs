# Power BI CAT Labs
## (https://aka.ms/powerbi_labs)

This site is a map of learning content produced by and curated by the Power BI Customer Advisory Team (PBICAT) team in Microsoft Engineering. These materials are meant to be instructor-led, but you can work through the materials on a test system on your own if desired. Labs are shorter and Workshops are more comprehensive. You can view all materials directly in this interface, or you can [view the raw github site for this content here](https://github.com/plebla372/labs).

## Learning how to self-learn

Many of these topics are quite deep, and take time to fully absorb. There are several phases of learning:

 - Awareness (You learn a technology exists and what it is used for)
 - Understanding (You learn the components, processes and steps of a technology)
 - Practice (You can perform the steps with the technology by following a process to complete a task)
 - Mastery (You are able to explain the technology to others)


These courses are designed for you to repeat many times to move through these phases. Before you embark on any of these, you may want to complete a "Learning how to Learn" course. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/education/edlife/learning-how-to-learn-barbara-oakley.html" target="_blank">You can find more information on that here</a>.
